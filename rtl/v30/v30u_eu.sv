//
//  v30u_eu - the ucore execution unit: micro-sequencer, loader march,
//            datapath and ALU.
//
//  THIS MODULE IS A TRANSLITERATION OF sim/exec_impl.h + sim/loader_impl.h +
//  sim/alu.cpp.  The governance rule (hdl/rtl/ucore/README.md) is that the
//  model is the SPEC: an RTL-vs-sim divergence is a bug HERE.
//
//  --- THE INVERSION (campaign risk #1) -------------------------------------
//
//  The model PUMPS the clock: the interpreter calls `charge(n)` / `pop()` /
//  `wait_read()` and the BIU ticks underneath it.  The RTL cannot do that, so
//  the interpreter is re-expressed as a state machine whose state is
//  "the step of the model's program that occupies THIS clock":
//
//    * every port the BIU samples (`q_pop`, `eu_post`, `eu_pair`, `q_flush`,
//      `eu_susp`, `eu_halt`) is a COMBINATIONAL function of EU REGISTERS ONLY
//      -- the state, the micro-row word standing on `upc`, and the datapath.
//      The model makes those acts "at clk_ == c, before tick(c)"; the RTL BIU
//      consumes them in its step (b) at the edge ending c.  Same instant.
//    * `charge(n)` becomes "this state occupies n clocks".
//    * every `while (...) tick()` becomes a STALL: the state is re-entered
//      and its acts are withheld.  There are five, and they are named:
//
//        stall_q       a queue byte is demanded and not ripe        (M8)
//        stall_opr     the F / OPR interlock                        (11.4/M13)
//        stall_slot    the EU's ONE bus-request slot is busy        (M10)
//        stall_retire  the retire deadline: a store owes its data   (7.7)
//        stall_pin     the 1BL retire lead / a halted part          (S9a)
//
//    * a model step that charges NOTHING (consuming a pre-popped opcode, the
//      pure-decode logic) is a ZERO-COST state: it is executed inside the same
//      edge that computed it, by the bounded chain loop below.  The loop is
//      how "several model steps ride one clock" is expressed.
//
//  --- THE SEQUENCER --------------------------------------------------------
//
//  upc = {page[2:0], opc[7:0], loc[3:0]}, 15 bits (U0 finding F1), and it is
//  the architectural SS-mapped flop: the two tables stand combinationally on
//  it (see v30u_ucrom.sv), so a restore has no hidden BRAM-address state.
//  `loc` is a 4-bit counter inside the opcode's 16-row block and CARRIES into
//  the opcode byte (ledger: IMUL 00B3 -> 0218).
//
//  --- CE DISCIPLINE --------------------------------------------------------
//
//  Nothing clocked runs unless `srst` or `ce`; reset is ungated so `bkd_load`
//  fires regardless of CE.  There is no negedge process in the EU.
//
//  U4 pass 3 -- WHERE `ce` IS.  The module is a NEXT-STATE FUNCTION
//  (`always @*`, producing `<reg>_n`) plus a REGISTER BANK
//  (`always_ff @(posedge clk) if (ss_we || srst || ce)`).  `ce` appears in the
//  commit and NOWHERE ELSE, which is the whole reason for the shape: written
//  the other way -- one clocked block whose third arm was `else if (ce)` --
//  Quartus extracted no clock enable, threaded `ce` through the EU's 61-level
//  cone to every flip-flop's DATA input, clocked the registers every SYS clock
//  and made the multicycle exception the divided CPU clock earns FALSE
//  (ledger sec.51.7).  The behaviour is identical either way and the full ladder
//  was re-scored to say so; the NETLIST is not.

//
//   "At every instruction boundary the machine first TAKES the trap if the arm
//    bit is set (and the entry clears it), and then SAMPLES `TF` into the arm
//    bit.  A PREFIX BYTE ENDS AN INSTRUCTION BOUNDARY."   -- §84.1, verbatim
//
// MEASURED against silicon on a directed board cell built for it (§85.2b):
// the floor is **3 clocks**, 121,890 rows at 0 row-diffs, with no other value
// in [1,7] within four orders of magnitude.  §84.7's PURE GATE -- "take at the
// first boundary at which TF has been up for at least N clocks" -- is REFUTED
// by that cell's two SATURATED controls (`popfmemr`/`popfmul`, whose first
// boundary sits 13 and 25 clocks past the rise): the chip STILL waits one more
// boundary there, so the fitting `N` sets are {5,6,7} against {26,27,28} and
// no `N` exists.  That is an arm bit, and it is measured.
//
// NOTHING HERE NAMES AN OPCODE.  §84.1 wrote the POPF/IRET asymmetry as an
// opcode rule; §84.3 re-read it as ONE FLOOR (007A and 01EA are both
// `OPR -> FLAGS  F E` rows with identical geometry -- what differs is CLOCKS,
// because `9D` retires AT its own flag write and `CF` flushed the queue at
// 01E8), and the cell's `iret`/`popfnone` pair MEASURES the consequence:
// phase 2 against phase 3 at both wait levels, which only a clock floor gets.
// THE DEPTH IS **4**, AND IT IS THE MEASURED FLOOR OF **3** -- the difference
// is a COORDINATE, and it is the one `ie_p` already pays.  The model stamps the
// rise in `sample_ie()`, called at the TOP of `tick()`, so a PSW bit that is up
// during clock `c` is stamped `rise = c`; block (a) here freezes `brk_now` from
// the same register at the same instant and it reaches `brk_p[0]` one flop
// later.  MEASURED, engine vs engine on the cell's own sleds:
// `rise_sim = rise_rtl + 1` on 8 of 8 first rises (`popfnone`/`popfclc`/
// `popfmul`/`iret` x w0, w3), so the model's `c >= rise + 3` IS this module's
// `c >= rise + 4`.  It is the same offset that makes the INT gate read
// `ie_p[2]` -- three flops -- where the model's `kIeFloor` is 2.
//
// AND SILICON SAYS SO INDEPENDENTLY.  §85's cell re-scored with this core as
// the engine, per clock over its 30 retained captures, at every candidate
// depth in [1,7]:
//     1: 71,304   2: 71,304   3: 33,941   **4: 0**   5: 14,630
//     6: 43,762   7: 61,033          (121,860 rows each)
// One value is EXACT and nothing else is within four orders of magnitude --
// the same shape, on the same captures, that gave the model its 3.
//
// `V30_BRK_FLOOR` is the INSTRUMENT KNOB that made that table possible and
// nothing else: a compile-time define with the landed value as its default, no
// gate sets it, and the synthesised design carries exactly `BRK_FLOOR` flops.
// (The model's is `V30SIM_BRKFLOOR`; this is the same instrument, RTL side.)
//   *Falsifier*: any capture on which a depth other than 4 scores fewer
//   row-diffs against silicon than 4 does.

// THE COMPOSITION (campaign risk #1, second half) -- F7, see the ledger
//============================================================================
// The BIU publishes TWO NAMED VIEWS of every quantity this module consumes
// (v30u_biu's "THE EU CONTRACT" block), and WHICH ONE to read is decided by
// WHERE the value is used, not by what a simulator happens to schedule:
//
//   * the COMBINATIONAL ACT DECODE below (`q_pop`, `eu_post`, `eu_pair`,
//     `q_flush`, `eu_susp`, `eu_halt`) reads the REGISTERED view -- `q_ripe`,
//     `q_byte`, `eu_slot_busy`, `eu_wr_done`, `eu_opr_free`.  An act is
//     consumed by the BIU on the clock that names it, so it must be decided
//     from the BIU's level DURING that clock;
//
//   * THE CLOCKED STEP reads the `_n` view -- `eu_slot_busy_n`,
//     `eu_rd_done_n`, `eu_wr_done_n`, `eu_rdata_n`,
//     `q_ripe_lead_n`, and the `*_n` stall wires derived from them.  That step
//     produces the EU's state for the clock this edge OPENS and must therefore
//     see the BIU as it will be then.
//
//   * `q_ripe` / `q_byte` are read by the clocked step in the REGISTERED view
//     and that is not an exception: the byte the step consumes is the one the
//     BIU handed over on the clock that is ending, which is the clock the pop
//     rode.  Everything else the step consults is the BIU it is stepping into.
//
// Nothing here depends on process order, and no `_n` signal reaches a
// combinational output of this module, so the EU->BIU direction stays a
// registered boundary and closes no loop.  REFUTED, and kept refuted: LATCHING
// the levels in this module -- that puts every pop one clock late (B8 500->123)
// because a latch delays the whole view instead of naming the two.

//============================================================================
// THE MICRO-ROW STANDING ON `upc`
//============================================================================
// L1 -- THE DECODE IS TAKEN ON THE EDGE THAT MAKES ITS ADDRESS.
//
// `ucdecode`'s address is {upc_page, upc_opc, upc_loc[3:2]} -- THIRTEEN BITS,
// every one of them a register in the one bank below, committed by the one
// condition `if (ss_we || srst || ce)`.  So the decode of the micro-address the
// bank is ABOUT TO COMMIT can be read on the edge that commits it, and the
// value standing on the table's output at every clock is then, BY
// CONSTRUCTION, the value the combinational read would have produced on that
// clock.  `dec_addr_next` (assigned beside THE COMMIT, below) is character for
// character the selection the bank applies to `upc_*`, so:
//
//    * the bank commits at c  ->  upc_*(c) is what dec_addr_next was formed
//      from at c-1, and dec_q(c) is `ucdecode` of that same value;
//    * the bank does not commit at c  ->  neither upc_* nor dec_q moves.
//
// THIS IS NOT RETIMING ACROSS A CLOCK.  It is taking a lookup on the edge that
// already determines its input -- the ghost relocation's own g_sp/g_bare
// pattern (capture at the defining event, consume registered) -- and it moves
// no pin on any clock.  It is also not the BANNED M10K conversion: an M10K puts
// the ROM's OUTPUT one clock LATE, which costs a cycle; this puts the LOOKUP
// one clock EARLY and the output on time.  THE COMMIT block's own comment
// already named it: *"upc_page_n / upc_opc_n / upc_loc_n exist as wires as a
// free consequence -- the only thing a registered microcode ROM ever needed."*
//
// WHY: `docs/notes/adcone_anatomy_2026-08-13.md`.  On CONTROL seed 5 the
// binding path is `upc_opc[7] -> nec_bus|ad_in_q[14]`, 25.031 ns of data path,
// and `ucdecode` is 4.770 ns / 5 of its 29 cells; over the top 60 paths into
// the observation registers it is on 60 of 60 at 4.691 ns per appearance.  It
// is single-cycle there because the rig's sampler is free-running (E-1 is
// deleted); it is FOUR cycles on the D pin below (the 4/3 CE multicycle), and
// the same move takes `ucdecode` AND `ucrom` off the existing
// `upc -> ucdecode -> ucrom -> chain -> upc_n` path.
//
// ⚠ THE ONE CLOCK WHERE IT IS NOT IDENTICAL, NAMED IN ADVANCE: before the
// first commit.  `dec_q` powers up 0, so `dec_valid` is 0 and `row_nop` is 1 --
// the model's NOP-CTL substitution, the safe direction -- where the
// combinational read would give `ucdecode[0]`, which F44's own probe proves is
// non-zero.  Every harness asserts `srst` before it observes anything and
// `srst` forces the commit.  Falsifier: the whole pin-sensitive ladder.
//
// NO SDC EDIT IS NEEDED OR TAKEN: `dec_q` is declared here, so its post-fit
// node is `...|v30u_eu:u_eu|dec_q[*]`, which `nec_test.sdc`'s $v30u_regs glob
// already selects, and it is `ce`-gated exactly as every other EU register.

// `_n` name for the clocked step.  ONE expression each, differing only in which
// BIU view it reads.
// F31 -- THE HOLD IS THE BIU'S COUNT, AND THERE IS ONLY ONE VIEW OF IT.
//
// The EU used to keep its OWN `opr_owned` counter of the stores it had paired
// and test it against the BIU's release PULSE.  That is F11's named error --
// one event, two reconstructions -- and it was wrong in both of its parts:
//
//  * the pulse view.  `opr_free_now_n` read `eu_opr_free_n`, the release
//    computed DURING the T2 clock, so the `F` row completed at the end of T2.
//    The model's release instant is `opr_free_clk_ = T2 + 1` and the row runs
//    ON that clock, i.e. T3.  Every non-OPR-reading `F` row therefore ran one
//    clock early, which is the whole multi-cycle-push family: `60`'s ROM
//    alternates `SIGMA -> IND CTL MEMW SS` with `<reg> -> OPR F CTL`, and the
//    idle `Ti` the golden shows between consecutive stores IS that clock.
//    (`60` was green on push #1 only, and only by accident: the FARJMP bubble
//    after 023B put the clock back.)
//  * the count.  The model's `++opr_held_` is CONDITIONAL --
//    `if (!(r == &cur_ && run_ && ci_ > 1))`, a fact about the BIU's own
//    running cycle -- and the EU cannot see it, so an EU-side count can never
//    be faithful.  `opr_owned += (pend_split ? 2 : 1)` also over-counted a
//    split against the pulse test: ALL 96 odd-SP `60` cases failed and ALL 104
//    even-SP cases passed.
//
// So the counter is the BIU's `opr_held` (which IS `BiuTimed::opr_held_`) and
// the published fact is the model's own predicate off the REGISTER.  One
// expression, both views -- the act decode and the clocked step cannot drift.
//

// is free from T3 (11.4, the FIXED index 2 that does NOT stretch).  With MD set
// the release is the store's own eu_done -- the completion eval + 2, the
// deadline `wait_bus()` already carries -- so it STRETCHES with the eval like

// in the whole part -- `0225 PFXCNT -> tmpa`, the REPX withdrawal's
// `PC := PC - PFXCNT - 1` rewind -- and a `REP` string is BY CONSTRUCTION
// reached through a prefix.  Under whole-program replay every mid-string
// interrupt would have resumed at the opcode instead of at the first prefix,
// i.e. the 8086 lost-prefix bug the V30's ROM exists to avoid.
//
// So `pfxcnt` leaves the deferred set and joins the debt: the reset is back in
// S_INSTR_END's immediate block (the successor's prologue, where the model puts
// it) and the post-`E` row reads the copy.  The debt is EIGHTEEN bits.
// *Falsifier*: any other ROM row that reads PFXCNT, or any edge-`c` decode-chain
// write to one of `iend_late`'s remaining fields.

//============================================================================
// THE ALU'S WIDTH IS THE WIDTH OF THE OPERANDS IT IS HANDED -- EXCEPT FOR THE
// MULTIPLY/DIVIDE UNIT'S OPERAND CONDITIONING, WHICH IS THE INSTRUCTION'S.
//
//     A 16-BIT OPERATION NEEDS TWO 16-BIT OPERANDS.  The ALU works at BYTE
//     width when EITHER of the two it is handed carries only eight
//     significant bits -- OR WHEN THE OPERATION IS ABS.
//
// `al_byte = op8` -- the instruction's w-bit, which stood here -- IS THE
// DEFECT, and ITS FLOP IS RETIRED (save-state code 9'h11A is now a hole).
// The REP entry test is ONE ROW BANK SHARED between the byte and the word
// forms (`docs/V20UC.TXT:186`, `001.1010010?.00 <rep> A4,A5`), so 0094's
// `CX -> tmpb | ALU PASS tmpb` computed Z over the LOW EIGHT BITS of CX on a
// byte string op: `REP MOVSB` with CX = 0x0100 read zero and ran ZERO TIMES.
// The 29-bit ROM row has no width field, so the row cannot be the source.
// JCXZ's 0140 is the SAME row shape and was right only by the accident of its
// w-bit.  (sim/alu.h carries the derivation and the four refuted rivals; the
// C++ leg is `be4eb2c32f`.)
//
// CLAUSE 2 -- ABS is the multiply/divide unit's operand conditioning, and that
// unit's width is the INSTRUCTION's by construction (8x8->16 or 16x16->32;
// 16/8 or 32/16).  What licenses the clause is CONFINEMENT, checked against
// the artifact independently of any score: `[-1E-]` occurs in EXACTLY THREE
// ROWS in the whole ROM -- 0184 (F6/F7 /5 IMUL), 0198 (F6/F7 /7 IDIV) and
// 0292 (69,6B IMULI) -- all of them that path, and 0198 being the DIVIDE entry
// is what makes it a statement about the shared iterative unit rather than
// about multiply.  *FALSIFIER*: any ABS row outside the multiply/divide path
// refutes it outright.  The test is on `eff_op`, the RESOLVED operation, since
// `ALU OPC` reaches ABS through `opc_base = INC` plus a ModR/M reg of 6.  It
// reads `op8_eff`, the same post-`E` rendering `eff_op` itself reads, and it
// is the same bit the ABS ARM already reads for its sign capture
// (`v30u_eu_row.svh`'s `sign_neg_n`), so magnitude and sign now come from one
// place instead of two.
//
// NOTHING LATCHES THE WIDTH, and it MUST NOT: `80/81/83` latch `ALU OPC tmpa`
// at 003E and only load port A with the r/m operand at 003F, ONE ROW LATER.
// It is read combinationally, at the instant the consuming row evaluates, from
// the tag of the register the port takes its operand from.  Port A is ALWAYS
// tmpb (a fixed read port, so its tag is always in the OR); port B is the
// register the row's `Tmp` field names, where `Tmp == 3` selects the hardwired
// ZERO rail -- a 16-bit constant, not a register, so WORD.  One OR of two tag

// THE SOURCE1 CLASSIFICATION.  `s1_byte` and `s1_wbyte` are DIFFERENT
// PROPERTIES, which is why the second is not just a copy of the first:
//
//   `s1_byte` is LANE REPLICATION -- the rail drives its eight bits on BOTH
//   halves of the source bus, so an H-half write (Dest1 22/23, which takes
//   bits 15:8) picks the same byte up.  Only Q and CONST do that.  It had NO
//   READER here and the row rebuilt the same expression inline; it is the
//   reader now, and the two cannot drift apart any more.
//
//   `s1_wbyte` is the DATUM WIDTH -- how many of the bits the rail presents
//   are significant.  It is what the ALU's flag taps and the iterative unit's
//   carry chain follow (`al_width_byte`).
//
// THE CRITERION IS ONE SENTENCE, the sibling-lane law of `rb16` generalised:
//
//     A RAIL IS TAGGED BYTE WHEN ITS UPPER LANE CARRIES SOMETHING THAT IS NOT
//     PART OF THIS DATUM.
//
// A rail whose upper lane holds a CORRECT extension -- a zero, a sign, a
// constant's leading zeroes -- presents a valid 16-bit number and is WORD,
// however small the number is.  "SMALL" IS NOT "BYTE": CONST, ZEROS, ONES and
// PFXCNT are clean 16-bit values.  Only four rails carry a foreign upper lane:
//
//   7     Q       the prefetched byte, driven on both lanes (that is `s1_byte`)
//   16    AL:AH   the HIGH byte read through the 8-bit rotator -- AH in the low
//                 lane with AL riding along as the sibling.  Its ROM consumers
//                 take the low lane as the datum (001B, 007C, 01DE, and
//                 018C/019D where it is the byte divide's dividend high half).
//   18/19 R / M   a BYTE operand read: the sibling byte sits on the unused
//                 lane, which is `rb16` itself.  The decoder's own width, and
//                 the only encodings it parameterises.
//   6     OPR     when a BYTE bus cycle filled it, the upper lane is the other
//                 half of the bus.  This is what makes CMPSB/SCASB compare at
//                 byte width (00A0/00A2 `OPR -> tmpb/tmpa`).
//
// The temps (12-14) and SIGMA (20) PROPAGATE the tag of what produced them.
// Everything else is WORD.
//
// The two disagree on CONST, and that is not a contradiction: `s1_byte` is
// read ONLY by the H-half writes, and NO ROM ROW EVER DRIVES AN H-HALF WRITE
// FROM CONST (measured: zero `CONST -> tmp?H` rows), so CONST's lane behaviour
// is unobservable and carries no evidence either way.  The datum criterion
// decides it, and it decides it WORD.

//
//   V1  this one, `ghost_relax` deleted                    +2 closed,  0 LOST
//   V2  V1 + the `(eu_ghost_idle && !q_ripe) ? SP` arm     +2 closed,  1 LOST

//   V4  V3 + the `pe_opc_reg == 8'h8e` case               identical to V2
//
// V3 and V4 score BYTE-IDENTICALLY to V2, so `ghost_uses_mul_hi` (the 0104
// PLA class, fitted on the v1 `mc2` banks that SUP-1 retired) and the `8E`
// special case are BOTH INERT on this corpus.  They are left standing because
// "inert on 654 seeds" is not "dead", and deleting a case on the strength of a
// population that never reaches it would be the same mistake in the other
// direction.  The seed V2 loses is `fz2c/410034`.
//

// measures `fz2e/530034` performing NO and at all and taking a different rail,
// and `fz2e/526054` forking on the SEGMENT with identical offsets.  The two

// fire: on `fz2e/528010` the posted value went from `SP` = 0x9537 (ODD) to the
// AND = 0x9504 (EVEN), the ghost read stopped splitting, and ONE SIX-CLOCK BUS
// CYCLE disappeared from a seed the campaign had dispositioned as IMMATERIAL
// (`bad_rows` 4 -> 2,067).  The chip's own T1 there is 0x8B92D, likewise ODD:
// silicon splits and the ucore had stopped.  The V2 arm was accidentally right
// about the SHAPE while being wrong about the ADDRESS, and restoring it would
// be re-installing a fitted arm to recover a coincidence.
//
// THE ADDRESS IS NOT TOUCHED.  Only which driver decides whether there are one
// or two bus cycles moves, and it moves to the driver the law already names.
// The un-relocated SPLIT PARTNER stays booked residue (relocation prereg
// §7(b)); `fz2c/406063` row 249 is its first measurement.
//

// own width arm, `ghost_next_byte || (eu_ghost_full && modrm_reg == 0 &&
// m_idx == 0)`) with an ODD `ghost_stack_phys`, and it went 8 -> 589 rows.
// `eu_word` IS `!acc_byte` on every non-ghost path -- that is its own default
// arm -- and it is NOT on the ghost's.  The lane mux and the split decision
// were reading two different widths.  So the ghost arm reads the width the
// ghost's own lane mux reads, and the statement is one sentence for both:
// AN ACCESS SPLITS IFF IT TRANSFERS A WORD ACROSS AN ODD BOUNDARY.

// SM3 SITTING 12 (R7') -- THE READ'S DATA EDGE, AND WHY IT IS A `D`-PIN MUX

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// `eu_rd_edge` is the ONLY thing in this module that carries the LIVE `READY`
// pin.  (By elimination, `sm3_s12_prereg_2026-08-04.md` §2: READY reaches
// `v30u_biu`'s next-state in three places; `ready_prev` goes straight to a
// flop; the `ts` advance reaches the EU only through `eu_slot_busy_n`, which
// `S_PRERD` consumes inside an arm that sets `stop` on every branch, so its
// cone ends at `row_posted_n`/`rd_pending_n`; everything else the EU reads --
// `q_ripe_lead_n`, `eu_rd_done_n`, `eu_wr_done_n`, `eu_rdata_n`,
// `eu_rd_edge_d` -- is REGISTER-ONLY.)
//
// It used to be applied inside block (a), i.e. it SEEDED `psw_n` at the head of
// the twelve-position chain, so one AND gate off the READY pin selected the
// input of the deepest combinational structure in the core.  MEASURED:
// `system_large|c_ready_q` -> `v30u_eu|opc_base[3]` at **62-63 logic levels,
// 51.2 ns against 31.25**, on 20,000 of 20,000 failing paths, Fmax 19.42 MHz
// (`docs/notes/sm3_s12_r7p/CTRL_cone.txt`).  The identical RTL closed at
// 45.67 MHz one sitting earlier: the fitter's physical synthesis happens to
// break that cone or happens not to (§70.5).  Same cone, same fix, as §52.3's
// `srst`.  With the load moved here the control is **42.37 MHz, 0 failing
// paths, worst `c_ready_q` path 19 levels**.
//
// THE RULE ITSELF IS UNCHANGED and it is `interrupt_model.md`'s:
//   "POP PSW consumes the popped image at its read's data edge -- the new IE
//    shows in the PS bits during the read's own T4."
// Only WHERE it is applied moves.
//
// `row_blocked` IS PART OF THE TAKE, AND IT IS THERE BECAUSE THE FORM WITHOUT
// IT WAS BUILT AND REFUTED (`sm3_s12b_prereg_2026-08-04.md` §1, seed
// `mc2/2788`).  Without it the two forms differ on exactly one shape: a SECOND
// read outstanding while an EARLIER one already sits in the completed-read
// store (`rd_pending=2`, `rd_done_cnt=1`, `rdq_n=1`), so `nr_have` holds,
// `nr_wait` is 0, the row is NOT blocked -- and the `OPR -> FLAGS` row RUNS on
// the same clock this data edge fires, writing `opr_live` (the EARLIER word)
// where the data edge wants `eu_rd_edge_d` (the CURRENT one).  Different
// values; the order decides.  The term is REGISTER-ONLY (`st`, `e_f`,
// `f_wait`), so it costs the cone nothing.
//
// WHY THE MOVE IS EXACT, in two cases that partition the clock:
//  * `row_blocked` HOLDS -- `S_ROW`'s `chain == 0` arm sets `stop` and assigns
//    nothing and positions 1-11 are skipped, so `psw_n` reaches the commit
//    equal to its preload `psw`, PROVIDED `poste`/`iend_owed` are not owed
//    (they run between the old write site and the chain and read-modify-write
//    `psw_n`).  That proviso is FALSIFIER (A) in the clocked observer.
//  * `row_blocked` DOES NOT HOLD -- the row is a pure register transfer
//    (`row_bus` false, `e_s1 == 6` not 7), so `row_acts_ok` holds, the step
//    performs `dest1 = FLAGS` and OVERWRITES `psw_n` entirely with
//    `s1_now = opr_live`.  Whatever block (a) put there was DEAD, so deleting
//    it changes nothing.  That is FALSIFIER (B).
//
// Both falsifiers are on the RAW take -- without `row_blocked` -- so they see
// every clock the old form would have written on, and they STAY in the tree.

// class one clock earlier, off the byte being popped, qualified by the cycle's
// DIRECTION: the announcement is a READ, so the pop+0 opcode's own direction
// bit (bit 1, the 8086/V30 encoding's `d`) must be CLEAR.
//

//   fz2c/410028 @2994 successor ED   fz2e/520066 @1249 successor EC
//   fz2e/527055 @655  successor 6D   fz2e/528030 @423  successor EC
// and `6F`/OUTM -- the identical `xop == 6` with bit 1 SET -- is the control:
// silicon says MEMR there, and `!q_byte[1]` says so without naming an opcode.
//
// THE ADDRESS IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT.  Routing
// this through `acc_io` would also strip the segment from `acc_phys_base`, and
// silicon does NOT: on three of the four seats the chip's ghost T1 address
// ALREADY AGREES with the core's (4070e, f79b0, fd93c) while the status
// disagrees.  On this cycle the space rail reaches the STATUS encoder and not
// the address adder.  (`fz2e/520066` also forks on the address; that half is
// the ghost-address cone and is not this landing's.)
//
// `q_ripe` is the same guard the pop+0 WIDTH rail uses one block up: with no
// ripe byte there is no decode standing, and the row's own space wins.  The
// PLA lookup is declared here rather than shared with that block so that this
// landing and the ghost-address work stay textually independent.
//
// !! THE OVER-FIRE IS NAMED, NOT FITTED AROUND.  `xop == F` also selects `F0`
// (LOCK) and `xop == 6` also selects `F9` (STC), both with bit 1 clear.  The
// ordinary path excludes them with the micro-row's `e_sr`, WHICH DOES NOT
// EXIST AT pop+0 -- there is no ROM row yet.  Taking the PLA class unqualified
// is therefore a PREDICTION, not a fit, and an F0/F9 exclusion is deliberately
// NOT written.
//
// FALSIFIER: (a) a capture in which an 8F mod==3 ghost whose pop+0 successor
// is an I/O READ opcode is announced MEMR by the chip; (b) one in which the
// same ghost with an F0 or F9 successor is announced MEMR -- that refutes the
// unqualified class and sends the predicate to a narrower carrier; (c) one in
// which a 6E/6F successor makes the ghost IOR.

// One `_n` per state register.  The clocked body below is now an `always @*`
// that preloads these from the flops and works on them with the SAME blocking
// assignments it always used -- so `_n` IS what a blocking write to the
// register meant there, and a module-level wire still reads the FLOP, i.e.
// the PRE-EDGE view this whole module is built on (F11b; see the recognition
// block's `EVERY read of these registers from inside the clocked step goes
// through these wires' note).  That is why the flops keep their names and the
// body was renamed, and not the other way round: nothing outside the body
// moves, so no combinational reader changes what it sees.
//
// THE POINT IS THE COMMIT.  `always @(posedge clk) if (ss_we||srst||ce)` puts
// CE on the register's ENABLE PORT.  Before this, `ce` was threaded through
// the EU's 61-level combinational cone to every FF's DATA input; Quartus
// extracted no clock enable (`report_timing`: `div_cnt[1]` -> `m_kind[0]`,
// 61 logic levels, terminating on `datac`/`dataf` and no `ena` node anywhere),
// so the registers clocked every SYS clock and the multicycle exception the
// divided CPU clock earns was INVALID BY ITS OWN FALSIFIER (sec.51.7).  `ce`
// does not appear in this cone at all now -- the body's third arm is the
// unconditional `else`.
//
// `upc_page_n` / `upc_opc_n` / `upc_loc_n` exist as wires as a free
// consequence -- the only thing a registered microcode ROM ever needed.
//
// *Falsifier*: a `v30u_eu` state register with no `ena` in the post-fit
// netlist, or a ladder cell that moves.  This is a SYNTHESIS-SHAPE change and
// the expectation is zero deltas.
