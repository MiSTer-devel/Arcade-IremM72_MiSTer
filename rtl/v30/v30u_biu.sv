//
//  v30u_biu - the ucore bus-interface unit.
//
//  THIS MODULE IS A TRANSLITERATION OF sim/biu_timed.{h,cpp}.  Every mechanism
//  carries its ledger tag (M1..M23, M2r, M5b, F1..F3) and the reference
//  model's own words, condensed.  The governance rule (hdl/rtl/ucore/README.md)
//  is that the model is the SPEC: an RTL-vs-sim divergence is a bug HERE.
//
//  --- THE SPINE: ONE EVAL INSTANT, DERIVED FROM ONE FLOP -------------------
//
//  M2r says the READY sample is the only wait-state mechanism and that it is
//  ONE INSTANT: the CPU registers READY at the end of every clock and one
//  clock later it (a) releases the status register and (b) runs the completion
//  eval at that clock's end.  The reference model computes the instant from
//  the wait count it knows (`e = w==0 ? 2 : 3+w`); the RTL does not know the
//  wait count and does not need to -- the instant falls out of two local
//  quantities:
//
//      eval instant  ==  the first clock with  dage >= 3  and  ready_prev
//
//  where `dage` is this cycle's age counted from its DISPLAY clock (0 on the
//  display) and `ready_prev` is the registered READY pin.  That this IS the
//  model's instant at every wait level, for the rig of hdl/rtl/nec_bus.sv:
//
//    w0   READY is high from T1 entry.  T1 = disp+1, so dage>=3 first happens
//         at T3 = index 2 == the model's `eval_i` at zero waits.
//    wN   READY is low from T1 entry and high from the LAST Tw, so ready_prev
//         is first high at T4 == index 3+N == the model's `eval_i`.
//    M22  a cycle whose T1 the bus made WAIT: the model counts the zero-wait
//         instant from the DISPLAY (`disp+3`), not from the T1.  That is
//         literally `dage >= 3`.  No second rule, no wait counter.
//
//  The HALT pseudo-cycle is the one access that does not go through the
//  arbiter (the HLT micro-row writes the status register directly) and its
//  MEASURED status release is at index 1 -- `dage >= 2`, wait-independent.
//  That is M21, and it is the only exception in the module.
//
//  Everything else is a FIXED OFFSET from the eval instant `e`:
//      e     status goes passive; OPR is released to a `-> OPR` row
//      e+1   the DISPLAY clock
//      e+2   the winner's T1; eu_done (read handover, store retire)
//      e+3   a fetched byte becomes POPPABLE
//  ...so the module carries `sev` (clocks since this cycle's own eval) and
//  initialises all three landing windows from it.  See the T4 block.
//
//  --- ABSOLUTE CLOCKS -> BOUNDED RELATIVE COUNTERS -------------------------
//
//  Every absolute `long` clock in the model (cmt_t1_, cmt_expire_,
//  pf_infl_to_, push_absorb_*, the QByte ready stamps -- and, until F56
//  deleted M6 in both engines, pf_land_*) is re-expressed as a
//  small counter, with a SYNTHESIS bound assertion (campaign risk #2).
//
//  --- THE EDGE -------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  The module is ONE next-state function (`always_comb`) and ONE register bank
//  (`always_ff`).  `r_<x>` IS the register -- the state the model has at the
//  START of `tick(c)`; the unprefixed `<x>` is the value that same register
//  takes at this edge, i.e. the state at the start of `tick(c+1)`.  The
//  next-state body is written with blocking assignments because they ARE the
//  model's sequential semantics, but they are now confined to one combinational
//  process, so NO consumer -- inside the module or outside it -- can observe an
//  intermediate.  See THE EU CONTRACT below for what the EU is allowed to read.
//
//  U4 pass 3 -- WHERE `ce` IS.  It is on the REGISTER BANK's enable
//  (`always_ff @(posedge clk) if (ss_we || srst || ce)`), not in the
//  next-state function, whose third arm is now the unconditional `else`.  The
//  two forms are identical in behaviour -- the next-state body preloads every
//  value from its own register, so a CE-low evaluation reproduces the register
//  and the commit is a no-op either way -- but only this one lets Quartus
//  extract a clock enable.  With `ce` inside the function it went into the
//  DATA cone instead: the BIU's registers clocked every SYS clock, and a
//  `v30u_biu` -> `v30u_eu` path was the worst violation left after the EU's
//  own exception (ledger sec.51.7, `r_q_cnt[3]` -> `m_kind[0]`).
//
//  One evaluation of the next-state function performs, in the model's order:
//
//     (a) capture the clock-c predicates that later steps must not re-read
//     (b) the EU's own acts, which the model makes at `clk_ == c` BEFORE
//         tick(c) runs: pop, post, pair, susp, flush
//     (c) tick(c)'s end-of-clock block: advance the cycle, land the bytes
//     (d) tick(c)'s completion / idle / flush eval
//     (e) tick(c+1)'s PRE-ROW block: expire the announcement, open the T1,
//         let a pending HALT take the register
//     (f) age the relative counters into their clock-c+1 values
//
//  ONE interface consequence, booked as a mapping note (U1 -> U2): the model's
//  `note_halt` / `unhalt` land in tick(c)'s PRE-ROW block, which in RTL is the
//  edge ending c-1.  `eu_halt` / `eu_unhalt` are therefore specified to LEAD
//  by one clock -- the same one-row-early control decode F2 already measures
//  for SUSP.  Nothing else in the interface leads.
//
//  --- CE DISCIPLINE (docs/notes/ce_plan.md) --------------------------------
//
//  Nothing clocked runs unless `srst` or `ce`; reset is ungated so `bkd_load`
//  fires regardless of CE.  There is NO negedge process in the BIU -- and,
//  with `v30u_eu.sv:48`, none anywhere in the synthesised core, since
//  2026-08-13.  `t1_half2` (the T1 AD half) is a POSEDGE flop enabled by
//  `ce_half`; it was the last negedge flop in the design.
//  ⚠ THE ARCHIVED FSM CORE (`hdl/rtl/core/v30_biu.sv`) KEEPS ITS NEGEDGE
//  `t1_half2` and is deliberately NOT touched -- `fsm_core_archive_2026-08-04.md`.
//
//  --- THE DE-MUXED BUS, AND `V30_MUXED_AD` (2026-08-14) -------------------
//
//  The V30 multiplexes one twenty-pin bus three ways because a 40-pin DIP has
//  no room for sixty pins.  Inside an FPGA that constraint does not exist.
//  THE WHOLE OF THE MULTIPLEXING LAW IS ONE SENTENCE:
//
//      A19-16 carries the ADDRESS's top nibble during the address ONE-SHOT
//      and the STATUS nibble otherwise; A15-0 carries the address low during
//      an address phase and the WRITE DATA otherwise.
//
//  It has exactly three operands -- an address, a write word, a status nibble
//  -- and every one of them was already a register in this module.  So the
//  de-mux is a RE-SLICING OF A MUX, not a new mechanism, and it adds NO FLOP.
//  The three are published as `addr_o` / `data_o` / `status_o`, which exist in
//  every configuration; their contracts are written at THE DE-MUXED BUS below.
//
//  `V30_MUXED_AD` selects whether the multiplexed VIEW exists at all.  It is
//  orthogonal to `SYNTHESIS` (fabric-vs-sim): this one is the BUS SHAPE.
//    defined   -- `ad_o` / `ad_oe_*` / `ce_half` / `t1_half2` are present, and
//                 `ad_o` is COMPOSED from the three ports above, so there is
//                 no second derivation to drift.  The rig builds this way and
//                 it is byte-identical to the pre-2026-08-14 behaviour.
//    undefined -- those PORTS are gone, `ce_half` and `t1_half2` with them
//                 (`t1_half2` has ZERO consumers in the next-state logic --
//                 `t1_half2_anatomy_2026-08-13.md` §1.3), and the read data
//                 arrives on the core's `DATA_I` instead of on `AD`.
//                 A define-OFF build is a DIFFERENT SAVE-STATE STREAM: the
//                 flop's address has no flop behind it and reads 0.  (Naming
//                 that address here would be a THIRD textual reference and
//                 `ss_lint` counts them -- it caught exactly that on this
//                 comment's first draft, as it did on the 08-13 one below.)
//
//  ⚠ WHAT THE DEFINE DOES NOT REMOVE, and this is a FINDING of the wave: the
//  multiplexed view's VALUE (`ad_o` / `ad_oe_*`) is still computed, because
//  THE AD OUTPUT LATCH HAS A FUNCTIONAL CONSUMER -- F58 makes a HALT
//  pseudo-cycle publish it (see THE AD OUTPUT LATCH below).  The shared-pad
//  drive is machine state, so a de-muxed core keeps it and drops only the
//  pins.  The phase it needs comes from `bus_half`, which is what `t1_half2`
//  equals at every `ce` -- derived from S-1 and ASSERTED, not assumed.
//  `docs/notes/demux_bus_prereg_2026-08-14.md`.

// has already crossed it.  A staged read tail normally owns the edge, except
// when a still-asserted maskable INT meets it after no write completion on the
// preceding clock: that case takes an ordinary eval on the flush edge (and
// therefore still has a separate announcement clock), not the direct-T1 path.
// A staged completion delays EMPTY except while a running non-fetch access is

// not the queue status port, so the redirect exposes EMPTY on its own clock;
// from T3 onward the data/READY tail owns the hand-over.  These are all
// existing phase/ownership rails: there is no interrupt counter, queue, or
// identity table.
//
// THE ASSERTED PIN WITHDRAWS THE DIRECT POINT ON *EITHER* TAIL.  `flush_int_live`
// was read by the staged arm only, and the empty arm took the direct point
// unconditionally.  It is ONE rail and it acts the same way on both: while the
// maskable pin is still asserted at the withdrawal the redirect takes an
// ordinary idle eval, so EMPTY stands on the FLUSH row and the announcement
// gets its own clock.  Two disjoint populations, each unanimous:
//   pin ASSERTED  -> ordinary eval : v0.1 `INT.F3AA`, 35 of 35 empty-tail
//                    withdrawals (rows 17-22 of each; the golden is silicon)
//   pin RELEASED  -> direct T1     : fz2c+fz2e, 17 of 17 empty-tail
//                    withdrawals over 623 seeds, all at pin low
// The rail is the PIN, not a flush-clock strobe, because the empty arm has to
// read it one row EARLY (`flush_pre`) as well as on the flush row itself.
// FALSIFIER: an empty-tail withdrawal whose maskable pin CHANGES between those
// two adjacent clocks -- the two reads then disagree and EMPTY is shown twice
// or not at all.  No instance exists in either population above.
//
// SOCKET, 2026-08-06, row 7.40.7 -> redirected CODE T1:
//   empty/direct: mc1/874, mc2/700,2408,3758; NMI-age boundary: mc1/410,607
//   staged/slow:  mc2/633,1616, t30-raw/235; live-INT exception: mc2/573
//
// ...AND THE STAGED TAIL FINALLY READS THE SAME RAIL THE SENTENCE ABOVE IS
// ABOUT.  `flush_int_live` is the MASKABLE pin, and both populations that
// sentence was measured on are maskable ones; the STAGED arm was given that
// rail alone and the NON-MASKABLE recognition was never given to it at all.
// `flush_src_live` is the recognition standing at the withdrawal, whichever
// unit raised it -- the live maskable pin, or the part's own NMI latch, which
// is exactly the pair `v30u_eu.sv` publishes as "the two interrupt rails that
// physically meet the withdrawal edge".
//
// It replaces `flush_staged_eval` IN THE DISPLAY ONLY, where that wire is
// subsumed by construction (`flush_staged_eval` implies `flush_int_live`
// implies `flush_src_live`).  **`flush_staged_eval` ITSELF IS NOT TOUCHED**,
// because it has a SECOND consumer that is not a display at all -- the idle
// clock's arbitration point in step (c) -- so this landing is display-only by
// construction as well as by intent.  ONE term swapped in ONE expression, one
// wire added, no flop and no save-state address.
//
// ...AND P1 IS THAT SECOND CONSUMER.  The paragraph above is A1's, and A1's
// own results named what it left behind: "after a REP withdrawal that is not
// bus-limited, the ucore's restart -- the redirected fetch and everything
// behind it -- is still one clock late."  It is ONE ARBITER and it must read
// ONE RAIL, so `flush_staged_eval` now reads `flush_src_live` too, and the
// display and the arbitration point are finally the same statement about the
// same edge:
//
//   a STAGED withdrawal yields the flush clock's arbitration point to the
//   redirect exactly when a recognition is standing at the withdrawal --
//   maskable pin or NMI latch, whichever unit raised it -- and nothing else
//   is outstanding (`flush_idle`).  The redirect then commits on the
//   withdrawal clock itself and its CODE status is announced at
//   `withdrawal + 1`, instead of being deferred to F3's flush-only point and
//   announced at `withdrawal + 2`.
//
// `!r_wr_done_p` -- "no write completion on the preceding clock" -- is DELETED
// rather than re-fitted.  It is a one-clock lookback with no mechanism behind
// it, and silicon falsifies it 2 for 2 on the only clocks in the fz2 corpus
// that exercise it (`fz2c/408000` and `fz2e/526025`, both `r_wr_done_p = 1`,
// both announced at `withdrawal + 1`).  `flush_stage` and `flush_idle` are
// KEPT: they are ownership rails with a stated mechanism, not fits.
//
// MEASURED, and the statement is exact rather than statistical.  Over all 677
// retained fz2 captures there are 20 REP-withdrawal clocks still in LOCKSTEP
// with silicon at the withdrawal.  Twelve are staged-and-idle with the NMI
// latch standing and the maskable pin RELEASED: silicon announces at +1 and
// the ucore announced at +2 on 12 of 12.  The other eight are unanimous the
// other way -- three have `run = 1` and never reach this arm, one has
// `cmt_valid = 1` and never reaches it either, one has `flush_pend = 0` so
// the suppression is already inactive, and three are empty tails on the
// `flush_direct`/`flush_fast` path -- and all eight ALREADY AGREE with
// silicon.  **The set of clocks this edit changes in the whole retained
// corpus is exactly those twelve.**
//
// FALSIFIER: a staged REP withdrawal on an idle clock with a standing
// recognition and no outstanding EU request, where silicon still announces
// the post-flush CODE status at `withdrawal + 2`.
// SECOND FALSIFIER, for the deleted term: the same, with a write completion
// on the preceding clock (`r_wr_done_p = 1`).
//
// NOT THE CANDIDATE THAT WAS PROPOSED, and the refutation is on the rows:
// `flush_nmi_young`'s fitted `<= 4` cannot be the carrier here, because
// `flush_direct` is 0 on all twelve by `flush_stage` ALONE -- upstream of it
// in the same AND -- and because `flush_nmi_young` is 1 on seven of the twelve
// and 0 on five while the divergence signature is identical on all of them.
// It is untouched.  `docs/notes/fz2_p1_prereg_2026-08-10.md`.
//
// MEASURED, fz2 corpus, and the statement is engine-free: over the 356
// retained event-free captures the EMPTY display is held by the
// REP-withdrawal suppression AND BY NOTHING ELSE on 13 clean-prefix rows; all
// 13 are the STAGED arm with the NMI latch standing, and silicon shows EMPTY
// on that very row on 13 of 13.  The `direct` arm produces no such row at all.

// SUCCESS in which these same rails are set at row 3257 while a CODE fetch
// owns the port (`qs_port_fetch`), and BOTH legs put EMPTY at 3259.

// on every GENUINE announcement including the T4 replacement (`fz2c/403020`
// row 170).  A withdrawn announcement is a status latch being RELEASED; a
// genuine one is a status latch being HELD into its T1.
//
// The end-of-clock sample is the one that MOVES THE MACHINE.  `nec_bus` -- the

// on `bs_q`, the end-of-clock sample (`nec_bus.sv` 322, 364-370), and it

//
// So the arm comes OUT and the mux's own release logic answers: the commit

// `halt_addr` in the pin mux and in `ad_oe_addr` below.
//
// F55 -- ...AND "IT STANDS ON THE PADS" IS **RETENTION**, NOT **DRIVE**.
//
// The paragraph above is right about what the pads SHOW and wrong about who
// puts it there.  This wire used to read `r_run && r_cur_halt`, which holds
// `ad_oe_addr` asserted for the WHOLE pseudo-cycle and republishes
// `r_cur_addr` on every clock of it.  A pad that is DRIVEN and a pad that is
// FLOATING at its last driven value are the same value by construction -- until
// a multi-clock announcement takes the pads in between and is then WITHDRAWN.
// Then the part shows the WITHDRAWN cycle's address and the re-driving HALT
// shows its own, and that is the whole of family E's address half: MEASURED on
// `s13-hltsweep-w2 HLT.INT idx 10/11` row 13 and `-w3 idx 12/13/14` row 15,
// and on the 30 S16 cells `w2 d10,d11` / `w3 d12,d13,d14` on all six programs.
// It is the SAME sentence as F53b one pin over -- a pad is loaded by a PHASE
// and held otherwise -- and `sim/biu_timed.cpp` already carries both (sec.80.A).
//
// WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE FOR SO LONG: `tb_v30_core.sv`'s composer is
// protocol-inferred and excludes a HALT-typed cycle from `core_ps_drive`, so
// the DEFAULT TB floats those clocks whatever the core does and scored the 35
// cells green ON THE INSTRUMENT'S AUTHORITY.  `system_large` keys on the
// core's own `AD_OE` port and does not; the fabric agrees with `system_large`
// on 1,654 of 1,654 cells (sec.80.B).
//
// So the address one-shot ends with the address PHASE, and `ad_oe_ps` below
// gains `!r_cur_halt` so that nothing else takes the pads either -- F51's
// "after its address phase it drives nothing", rendered as an enable and not
// as a value.  No flop is added, nothing outside the pin mux is touched.

// value for exactly ONE clock -- the display clock, `r_cdage == 0` -- and
// `data_ps(seg)` on every clock after it until the T1.
//
// AN INTA HAS AN ADDRESS PHASE TOO; its value is simply ZERO (it announces no
// address).  So the same one-shot governs it, and the `20'h0` term below was
// the identical defect one cycle-type over: MEASURED on
// `s10-hltsweep-w0 HLT.INT idx 4/5` row 11 (`INTA T4`, golden nibble `6`,
// ucore `0`) and row 12 (a LATE `INTA T1`, golden `6`).  A NON-late INTA T1
// carries `0`, exactly as `t1_addr` carries the address there -- rows 17/18 of
// the same cell, and `-w2 idx 10` row 14.
//
// No flop is added and nothing outside the pin mux is touched.

// clocks of one announcement, or a segment status on the display clock itself.

// still in the address one-shot?" -- each carrying its own copy of the status
// value.  They are `bus_ph_hi`'s `(r_cdage == 3'd0)` and `!r_cur_late_t1`

// `ad_o` IS that reconstruction now, so such a check is a tautology.  This one
// compares the composition against the pin law that 169,000 golden cases,

// THE AD OUTPUT LATCH.
//
// ⚠ 2026-08-14, AND IT IS WHY THE MULTIPLEXED VIEW IS COMPUTED IN EVERY
// CONFIGURATION: this latch has a FUNCTIONAL CONSUMER.  Its two registers feed
// `cmt_addr`/`cmt_data` of the HALT pseudo-cycle's announcement in step (e),
// so the shared-pad drive is MACHINE STATE and not presentation, and a core
// that presented a de-muxed bus while dropping it would be a different machine
// from the one silicon measured.  `V30_MUXED_AD` therefore removes the PORTS
// (`ad_o`/`ad_oe_*` here, `AD`/`AD_OE` on the top) and NOT this.  The de-muxed
// build still computes what the core would drive on the shared pads; it simply
// does not have any.
//
// F58 -- THE HALT PSEUDO-CYCLE ANNOUNCES NOTHING OF ITS OWN.
//
// `last_ad_*` is the AD OUTPUT LATCH, split into exactly the two lanes the two
// output enables already split it into: A19-16 is loaded whenever the core
// drives A19-16 (`ad_oe_addr || ad_oe_ps`) and AD15-0 whenever it drives
// AD15-0 (`ad_oe_addr || ad_oe_data`).  It is pad retention on the DRIVE side,
// the same sentence as `last_ube` above one bus over, and it stores nothing
// the die does not already have to have.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR.  The HALT display used to publish
// `{data_ps(2'd2), last_fetch_addr}` -- a value of its own, sourced from the
// prefetcher.  MEASURED on silicon, 1,189 HALT pseudo-cycles over the 725
// retained fz2 captures, chip leg only: the HALT publishes the value the AD
// output latch ALREADY HOLDS, on both lanes, 1,189 of 1,189 with no exception.
// The two rules agree exactly when the last bus cycle before the HALT was a
// CODE fetch -- because then the last value the core drove on AD15-0 IS the
// last fetch address -- and that is 1,164 of the 1,189, which is why the HLT
// sweeps, whose program is the one byte `F4`, cannot tell them apart and why
// this stood for the whole ucore campaign.  The 25 sites where the last cycle
// was a data cycle (MEMW 12, MEMR 9, IOW 4) are exactly the 25 HALT displays
// of the 24 `B1` seeds in the fuzz-v2 failure ledger, with nothing left over.
//
// It is NOT F55, which is landed and is not disturbed here: F55 is about who
// holds the pads for the BODY of the pseudo-cycle (nobody -- all three enables
// are low and the pads retain), and this is about the value published in the
// pseudo-cycle's own ADDRESS PHASE, which the core does drive and silicon does
// drive with it.
//
// Falsifier: a capture whose HALT display or HALT T1 carries a value the core
// had not itself last driven on that lane -- in particular any HALT whose
// AD15-0 is the DATA of a preceding READ (which the memory drove, not the
// core), or whose A19-16 is not the preceding cycle's segment status.
// Second falsifier, on the RENDERING rather than the law: this latch is read
// by the display decision from its REGISTERED value, so a HALT display whose
// immediately preceding clock is the only clock of a WITHDRAWN announcement
// would publish one announcement too far back.  No such site exists in the
// 1,189; if one is ever captured, the read has to move, not the law.
